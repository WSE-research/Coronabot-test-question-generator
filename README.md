# Coronabot Test Case Generator

## Create a test configuration

Change the Jupyter notebook `coronabot-test-case-generator.ipynb` until it fits your test requirements.

It will create a test confirguration file that can be read and executed by the script `evaluate-qanary-system.py`.

## Run a test configuration

`python3 evaluate-qanary-system.py --directory=DIRECTORY`

where `DIRECTORY` is the name of the directory where the test configuration file is stored.
